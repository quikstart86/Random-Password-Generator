# Random-Password-Generator

## [Description](#description)

This challenge required us to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they’ve selected by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## [Acceptance Criteria](#acceptance-criteria)

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a Random Password Generator that satisfies a typical hiring manager’s needs:

* Generate a password when the button is clicked
* Present a series of prompts for password criteria
* Length of password* At least 8 characters but no more than 128.
* Character types: Lowercase, Uppercase, Numeric, Special characters ($@%&*, etc)
* Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected
* Once prompts are answered then the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page

## [Installation](#installation)

I started by creating a new repo on GitHub giving it a unique name and then cloning it to my local environment using GitBash. I then created a few folders to house the CSS and assets. I created an index.html / script.js / style.css file in gitbash using 'touch' and then began to work through the files. Coding in the JavaScript first, to create the code structure, and then once sufficiently built out, I proceeded to work on the HTML and CSS. With any new major features/changes to the the code I added (git add -A) the changes, committed the changes (git commit -m " ") and then pushed them up to my remote repo on GitHub (git push origin).
